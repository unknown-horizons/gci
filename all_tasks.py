('Gameplay trailer', '''\
	<p>Did you know what Unknown Horizons is all about before this GCI?</p>
	<p>Perhaps you even checked our website -- did that help?</p>
	<p>We are looking for nice, short videos showing a few minutes of Unknown Horizons gameplay.
	Somebody interested in our game should get all important pieces of information about UH.</p>
	<p>Compare the <a href="http://flarerpg.org/">Flare homepage</a> for an idea about how such a
	video could be integrated with our main homepage. The ticket attached to this task has links to
	several examples of older UH trailers and other open source game trailers as well.</p>
	<p>The purpose of the video is to give interested players an introduction into what the game
	is about and how it is played. The player should be presented all major features (settling 
	on a new island, building buildings, the AI, trading, etc). This way the player can easily 
	decide if Unknown Horizons is the right game for him/her.</p>
	<p>We also offer another task to create a 2012.2 release video if you're interested!</p>''',

('Pootle guide: Interface', '''\
	<p>Our translation server <a href="http://pootle.unknown-horizons.org/pootle.fcgi">Pootle</a>
	is used to manage translations of core game content as well as for example scenarios.</p>
	<p>Because its user interface changed recently and since many interested translators might
	never have seen something like Pootle before, a visual guide would be great to offer.</p>
	<p>The basic idea is to provide a series of short text paragraphs accompanied with screenshots
	(cropped to the important area where that's useful) explaining <ul>
	<li>First steps (Account registration, user profile, profile picture via
	<a href="http://www.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a>)</li>
	<li>Translation (Submit, suggest, fuzzy, <code>{variables}</code>)</li>
	<li>Quality assurance (Review suggestions, search bar + checks, commit to VCS)</li>
	<li><b>Bonus:</b>Testing (Download and compile <code>.po</code> files, string previewer)</li>
	</ul>We have a few text-only guides for parts of the above, the most interesting one for you

('Inventory legend position', '''\
	<p>This task is a small programming task: you have to change the size of a widget.
	This widget is an <i>inventory</i>. Inventories inform players about which resources they can
	store currently. Since there are multiple inventory types in UH, this is important to know.</p>
	<p>You can find the widget in the 'Settlement Inventory' tab of the warehouse. A screenshot
	illustrating the current problem is attached to the ticket this was reported in (see below).
	The inventory widget has to fit in the tab correctly and the legend that currently overlaps
	with some empty slots needs to be moved down a bit. As mentioned in the ticket comments, merely
	adapting the current position in this specific xml file might be the easy way out, but is very
	likely to break things yet again at a later point.</p>
	<p>Instead we'd like a dynamic approach to place icon and legend in the code. An inventory
	widget knows its current size, </p>
	<p>If you haven't installed Unknown Horizons from our development sources yet, you won't be
	able to work on this task! Check our instructions on how to do that:
	<a href="http://www.unknown-horizons.org/download/sources/s-linux/">Linux</a>,
	<a href="http://www.unknown-horizons.org/download/sources/s-windows/">Windows</a>.</p>

	<p>Since loading a savegame can take some seconds even on faster machines, we use this time to
	display certain messages. They are supposed to help players who are new to Unknown Horizons as
	well as explain some of the more tricky parts or well-hidden helpful features.
	Help us by adding more of those tips! You should check the ticket comments for some ideas (the
	related ticket is linked below) -- but we encourage you to give UH a spin and add your own tips
	and hints as well!</p>

#('Graphics and color blindness', '''\
#	<p>Most of our interface is designed and coded by people without malfunctioning color
#	vision. There are several impairments related to how colors are observed by others.
#	Learn more about the topic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness"> on
#	Wikipedia</a>. The percentages listed there might surprise you!</p>
#	<p>Your task is to make Unknown Horizons easier for these players by finding problems with our
#	current interface colors and suggesting graphics we should revise with this in mind.</p>
#	<p>Converting a screenshot to black and white can (to some degree) simulate the way color blind
#	people see, since then all color info is gone, and only the luminosity differences are visible.</p>
#	<p>If you happen to know a color blind person: their feedback is very welcome and a nice bonus!</p>''',

##TODO more explanations about selection code location

#('Faster multiselection', '''\
#	<p>When drawing a very large selection rectangle, the game takes up to a few seconds to process
#	this. The bottleneck is probably the <code>getMatchingInstances</code> call.</p>
#	<p>This should not happen, it would be preferable if calculations were done in the background
#	while the game continues without interruptions.</p>
#	<p>One solution might be to fake an incremental search: The rectangle where units and buildings
#	are selected is partitioned into smaller rectangles, and an update only checks the rectangles
#	at the fringe. These updates could be spread over a number of ticks too, e.g. such that it
#	takes 0.5 sec max in total. This way, the game could feel slightly faster in this use case.</p>
#	<p>Other suggestions might be better than this one and you are encouraged to propose them!</p>

#	with the improved one.</p>''',

#('Icons unified', '''\
#	<p>We're currently showing small images (icons) in our build menu to indicate what kind of

#	are so-called production buildings, i.e. they produce goods. This production is also visible in
#	the overview tab (which is displayed after selecting buildings) and we use icons for resources
#	here, too.</p>
#	<p>Mostly, players are interested in exactly that: They are looking for a certain building that
#	will provide one specific resource. Thus, we want to use the icons of output resources as build
#	menu icon for each building where this is applicable and not confusing.</p>
#	<p>Your task: Assemble a list of buildings in all our currently four tiers where the build menu
#	icon does not match the icon of the main resource produced there. Should there be multiple
#	resource productions (such as at the farm), an own icon is fine. If you're looking for a bonus

#	shape so that maintainability does not suffer.</p>
#	<p>Your task: Logic and actual worker functions should be split up in at least 2 files,
#	probably 3 also is a good landmark. You will have to actually read the documentation about what
#	each function does, confirm that by reading the code and then decide what goes where!</p>''',
